# Suricata Interactive Setup Tool

This project provides a modular, interactive command-line utility for configuring and managing Suricata on Ubuntu systems. It simplifies Suricata setup, ensures safe configuration updates, and validates changes before restarting the service.

---

## Features

* Interactive setup via prompts (choose interface, IDS/IPS mode, log directory, ruleset)
* Automatic backup of `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` before changes
* Ensures Suricata YAML headers (`%YAML 1.1` + `---`) are preserved
* Config validation with `suricata -T` before restarting service
* Safe service restart only on valid configs
* Modular design for easy extension
* Self-elevating script (automatically runs with `sudo`)

## Installation & Initial Launch

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/suricata-setup.git
   cd suricata-setup
   ```

2. Make the installer executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   This will:

   * Remove any old Suricata installs
   * Install dependencies and Suricata from Ubuntu repositories
   * Enable and start Suricata service
   * Install and enable Emerging Threats Open rules
   * Launch the interactive setup tool (`suricata-setup.py`)

---

## Usage

If you need to run the interactive setup again:

```bash
./suricata-setup.py
```

The script will:

1. Relaunch with `sudo` if not root
2. Detect network interfaces and prompt selection
3. Ask for IDS or IPS mode
4. Ask for log directory
5. Let you choose rule source (ET Open or local)
6. Backup and update `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`
7. Validate config (`suricata -T`)
8. Restart Suricata service if config is valid

---

## Safety Features

* Backup: Saves `.bak` file before each change
* Validation: Uses `suricata -T` before restart
* Fail-Safe: Will not restart Suricata if config is invalid

## Example Walkthrough

```
=== Suricata Interactive Setup ===

Available interfaces:
1) eth0
2) lo
Select interface to monitor: 1
Run mode (ids/ips) [ids]: ips
Log directory [/var/log/suricata]: /var/log/suricata

Rule sources:
1) Emerging Threats Open
2) Local rules
Select ruleset [1]: 1

[+] Backup saved: /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml.bak
[+] Config updated: /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
[*] Validating Suricata config...
[+] Config validation successful.
Restart Suricata service now? (y/n) [y]: y
[+] Suricata restarted.
```

## Requirements

* Ubuntu (20.04+ recommended)
* Suricata installed (`sudo apt install suricata`) — handled by `install.sh`
* Python 3.8+
* Packages: `pyyaml`, `psutil`

## Future Enhancements

* Auto-restore last known good config if validation fails
* Support for advanced rule management (categories, enable/disable)
* Integration with ELK/Graylog for log monitoring
* TUI (text-based UI) for improved interaction
